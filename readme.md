1. My site is called Your Personal Mixologist and is deployed at https://your-personal-mixologist.herokuapp.com/
2. My site provides a platform for users to find various cocktail recipes.
3. I implemented all the search and filter features the API provided, as well as a random selection option. I also provided a landing page with popular ingredients to choose from in case the user needed inspiration. I wanted to provide as much flexibility in the application as possible.
4. The website first requires the user to verify that they are of the legal drinking age. It then brings you to a landing page with several image thumbnails of popular drink ingredients, as well as a side navigation bar. The user can choose to search by drink name, ingredient, or the first letter of a drink. The user can also choose a random selection or list all of the ingredients available to search from. I have also provided the user an option to create an account so they can store recipes for later use.
